---- DATA SET ----
The raw data for this data set is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone during various activities. Different subjects performed certain activities multiple times.  The tidy data set contains the average value per feature for each subject and activity. 

---- VARIABLES ----
The tidy data set contains of 2 nominal and 79 numerical variables. 

Nominal variables:
SUBJECT  - Individual who performed the activity during the measurement 
ACTIVITY - Activity performed by the subject during the measurement

Numerical variables:
All numerical vriables in this dataset are averaged for each subject and each acitivity and are nomalized between [-1,1] and have no units. The following variales are present:
